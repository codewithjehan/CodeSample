This is code I wrote for an app I built. The main class is DriverService, a small class located in the service layer, with the web API controllers making calls to it.
The DomainResponse class is a generic class used to return responses. This code showcases:


* Dependency injection using interfaces and constructor injection.
* Asynchronous method calls that are non-blocking.
* Mappers for transforming domain/data objects into contract objects.
* Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with the use of command and query services.
* Single Responsibility and Modular code principles.
* Text and error management, avoiding the use of magic strings.
* Generic classes and methods.
